Question 2
I do NOT release these program so that you "the end-user" can benefit from it in the term of using software or any other of these releases without buying the required licenses. R@1n, however, believe that everyone should have the option to test and backup their program and be able to run it without any problems.

Further, I do NOT in any way condone the spreading of this program, in other words I do NOT spread the releases to any websites, P2P networks or any other public available location. I urge that this releases should not be spread like that at all.
